I'm a data scientist at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). From time to time, I give a hand on data 
engineering projects. Research interests include probability theory, machine learning and applied data science.
\\I love math, I love data science, and I do my best to understand clearly how both apply to 
real-world scenarios.
