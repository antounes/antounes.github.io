I'm a data scientist at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). From time to time, I give a hand on data 
engineering projects. Before joining Jellyfish, I worked as a data analytics engineer within the mining industry, 
building predictive models for on-site ore process optimisation.


More broadly, I'm a STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and about how statistics, linear algebra and 
computer science combine to provide us with powerful frameworks for solving problems. My research interests include 
machine learning, applied data science and computational advertising.

When not in front of a computer coding or reading papers while listening to France Musique, you'll most probably 
find me training on my bike. I've been riding and building bikes since I was 8, racing on MTB, CX, track and road. 
I love math, I love data science, and I do my best to understand how both apply to real-world scenarios.
