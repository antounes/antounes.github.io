I'm a Machine Learning Engineer. I love data, I love machine learning, and I like to understand both clearly and use them 
well. 

My work and research interests include machine learning, applied data science, and cloud computing. More broadly, I'm a
STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and how data analytics and computer science combine to provide us with 
powerful frameworks for solving actual problems.

When not in front of a computer reading tech blogs, research papers or coding while listening to France Musique, you'll 
most probably find me training on my bicycle. I've been building bikes and cycling since I was 8, racing in MTB, CX, track
and on the road.
