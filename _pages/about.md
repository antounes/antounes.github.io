I'm a Data Engineer at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). From time to time, I give a hand
on machine learning engineering projects. I love data, I love machine learning, and I like to understand both clearly and use them well. 

My work and research interests include cloud computing, data engineering, and machine learning. More broadly, I'm a
STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and how data analytics and computer science combine 
to provide us with powerful frameworks for solving problems.

When not in front of a computer reading tech blogs, research papers or coding while listening to France Musique, you'll most 
probably find me training on my bicycle. I've been building bikes and cycling since I was 8, racing in MTB, CX, track
and on the road.
