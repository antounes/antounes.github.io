I'm a data engineer at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). I love data, I love machine learning, 
and I like to understand both clearly and use them well. 

My research interests include data engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. More broadly, I'm a
STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and how probability theory, statistics, and computer science 
combine to provide us with powerful frameworks for solving problems.

When not in front of a computer reading research papers or coding while listening to France Musique, you'll most 
probably find me training on my bicycle. I've been building bikes and cycling since I was 8, racing in MTB, CX, track
and on the road.
