I'm a data scientist at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). From time to time, I give a hand on data 
engineering projects. Before joining Jellyfish, I worked as a data analytics engineer within the mining industry, 
building predictive models for on-site ore process optimisation.


More broadly, I'm a STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and about how Stats, Linear Algebra and Computer
Science combine to provide us with powerful frameworks for solving problems ranging from simple housing price prediction 
to complex speech recognition. My research interests include Probability Theory, Machine Learning and Applied Data 
Science.

When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm most probably sitting on my bike saddle. I've been riding and building bikes 
since I was 8, racing on MTB, CX, track and road. I love math, data science and data engineering. I do my best to 
understand these universes well and explain them clearly.
