I'm a data scientist at [Jellyfish](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us). From time to time, I give a hand on data 
engineering projects.\\
I love math, I love machine learning, and I like to understand both clearly and use them well. 

My research interests include machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. More broadly, I'm a
STEM enthusiast passionate about pattern discovery and how probability theory, statistics, and computer science combine
to provide us with powerful frameworks for solving problems.

When not in front of a computer reading research papers or coding while listening to France Musique, you'll most 
probably find me training on my bicycle. I've been building bikes and cycling since I was 8, racing in MTB, CX, track
and on the road.
