One day, I worked on a project that used machine learning for supply chain management. After having received the brief, 
I did what I had always done when facing such situation: I looked for research papers.

## A vast world of opportunities for analytics

Supply chain management consists in overseeing production flows of goods and services within organisations. The field 
offers several possibilities for applying data analytics processes and taking advantages of the use of machine learning.
Good use of data can be made for selecting and segmenting suppliers, predicting supply chain risks, etc. More direct 
impact on businesses can be assessed by developing systems that forecast demand and sales, production levels, help in 
inventory management, transportation and distribution, and are implied in sustainable development and circular economy.\
Today, a large amount of interactive data are created almost continuously in different industries, and help in controlling
and operating processes. Being able to extract, manipulate and interpret information from these always growing volumes of
data is key for organisations searching for benefits. Supply chain professionals are therefore seeking to reach smart supply
chain.

## Machine learning, a good candidate for supply chain management

Authors investigate a variety of ML algorithms as candidates for solving supply chain management related problems. Concerned
problems include 
* supplier selection 
* supplier segmentation
* risk prediction
* demand and sales estimation
* production
* inventory management
* transportation. 

Tested ML algorithms include 
* supervised learning algorithms (decision trees, naive bayes, support vector machines, k-NNs, supervised neural networks)
* unsupervised learning algorithms (k-means, PCA, unsupervised neural networks)
* semisupervised learning algorithms (self-training, transductive support vector machine)
* ensemble learning (boosting, bagging)

This was a very broad overview of the work that exists on the use of ML for supply chain management.
