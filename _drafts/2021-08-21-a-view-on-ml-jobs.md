My interest in machine learning dates back from 2015, when I was doing my masters project as a research engineer for a 
top mining company. Industry was quite still in its infancy, although the "Big Data" boom had already exploded. Well, things
escalated quickly.

## Big Data, what was it all about ?

At the beginning, big data was about "a continuously growing volume of accessible data". Everyone was talking about the 
3 Vs of big data (Volume, Variety, Velocity), which have actually become today's 4 Vs of big data 
(adding up _Veracity_ to the list).\
As a freshly graduated engineer in France, I went to the UK to pursue a Masters, mainly focusing on geostatistics. I loved 
math, and I liked using computers for solving problems, so why not applying it to an area where there was plenty of new 
things to do? At the end of the year, I got a 6-month research project for a mining company, and after having briefly defined 
the topic with my supervisor, we decided to investigate the potential of using machine learning for solving geostatistical 
problems.
